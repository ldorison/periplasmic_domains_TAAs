accession: the accession number in the UniProt Database 

sequence: the sequence of the TAA

start and end: start and end of the YadA anchor domain 

full length: full length in residues of the protein 

taxID: the corresponding NCBI taxonomic identifier

diff: full length - end -> gives the size of the periplasmic domain 

size nter: size of the extracellular fraction of the adhesin 

prediction: information about the presence of the signal peptide, identified with signalP 6.0 in slow mode.
